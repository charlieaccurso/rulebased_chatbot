# rulebased_chatbot
Simple outline of a rulebased chatbot for bank payments.

NOTE: This is NOT a complete implementation of a rulebased chatbot. It is a framework upon which a fully practically deployable chatbot can be developed.
This implementation is meant to demonstrate the use of regular expressions, intents, and entity capture in closed domain chatbot design.
